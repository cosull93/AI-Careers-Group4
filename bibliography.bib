	abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) and automation technologies advance fast, substantial discussion remains about their influence on jobs and employment. Some expect enormous job losses and structural unemployment as computers and algorithms replace human workers in a variety of industries. However, the prevailing scholarly viewpoint is that, while AI will revolutionize work, it will not result in long-term job losses. AI is projected to have a net impact of job shifting rather than job loss by increasing productivity, accelerating economic growth, changing the structure of jobs, and allowing sectoral employment transitions. Â Detailed productivity evaluations show a strong correlation between productivity gains and net job creation. A 2022 meta-analysis of 127 papers indicated that productivity increases consistently improve employment and wages. Additional cross-country data from the OECD shows this association across a wide range of industrialized and emerging countries. Meanwhile, long-term data reveal that working hours have steadily decreased in recent decades without causing significant job losses, while productivity and earnings have increased in parallel. Integrating AI to automate monotonous jobs and improve human capabilities could fuel this trend. Displaced workers can transfer into new occupational jobs with adequate skilling and transition support rather than facing long periods of unemployment. Sectoral shifts have also characterized historical labor market evolutions following technology disruptions. As innovative industries outcompete legacy ones, economies undergo structural transformations. Current trends show that services are expanding while manufacturing is contracting in most sophisticated countries. AI and automation will most certainly speed the shift of occupations from manual production to skilled service roles, hence facilitating this transition. With appropriate government provisions such as retraining programs and educational expansions, the necessary employment transitions between sectors can occur smoothly rather than disruptively. In summary, while the AI revolution will fundamentally alter labor markets, effective governmental measures can ensure that job shifting outpaces loss. Workers must be supported in regularly adapting their skill sets and transitioning into new roles. Firms should invest in personnel skill development as well as smart technology integration. And governments should develop multiple ways to assist different groups in navigating the transitions, including the extension of social safety nets where appropriate. With coordinated efforts to optimize human-AI collaboration, this technology tsunami does not have to result in negative job impacts, but can instead place people in more rewarding, higher-value jobs. The view remains cautiously encouraging, providing stakeholders focus on boosting human talents to share in the AI-driven productivity windfall rather than simply displacing them.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on economic growth and job creation, focusing on its role in enhancing productivity across various sectors. As AI technologies advance, they are reshaping industries by automating routine tasks, optimizing processes, and driving innovation. The integration of AI into traditional industries, such as manufacturing, agriculture, and retail, has led to significant productivity improvements and economic growth. However, the rise of AI also presents challenges, including job displacement and the need for reskilling the workforce. This paper examines these challenges and proposes policy implications and strategies to manage the transition to an AI-driven economy effectively. By analyzing emerging trends in AI and forecasting future economic and job market changes, this paper highlights the need for proactive measures, such as education and skills development, supportive government policies, and responsible corporate practices. The findings underscore the importance of a collaborative approach to harnessing AI\&\#039;s potential while addressing its broader societal implications. Ultimately, this paper provides insights into the future directions of AI, emphasizing the need for strategic planning to ensure that AI-driven economic growth is inclusive and sustainable.},
